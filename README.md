# LoadApp


Created a custom view button that animates while download is in progress. A notification will be sent once the download is complete. When a user clicks on notification, the user lands on detail activity and the notification gets dismissed. In detail activity, the status of the download will be displayed and animated via MotionLayout upon opening the activity.
